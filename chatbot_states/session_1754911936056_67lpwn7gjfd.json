When you mix soil samples with the reagents, a color change indicates the concentration of nitrogen. The results can help determine soil fertility.\n\n2. **Laboratory Analysis**: Soil samples can be sent to a laboratory for more precise analysis. The laboratory will measure total nitrogen, nitrate (NO3"
